The goal of the assignment is to fetch json data and render to the page. I developed extra features to build upon the project. I implemented a MERN stack with GraphQL in which a user can sign in, create an account, and create, edit and delete posts. This project demonstrates my ability to fetch data and render to the page using typescript and react.

## Installation

In order to install this project you must pull down the code from my github at https://github.com/rossgilman402/Take-Home-Challenge. Run npm i, npm run seeds to access the data given and npm run develop to get the program started. To use you must create an account in order to see all other users posts and to create new posts. You can edit your own posts by navigating to the Profile page and clicking on the specific post. You can download any post on the dashboard once you click on the check box and click the download button.

## Goals

```
Display a list of images. Make a GET request to /pets to retrieve a JSON array of JSON objects that represent pet objects. These JSON objects will include properties like an image URL, title, description, entity creation date. You need to present these images and associated data in a compelling and interactive way. Use fetch for fetching data.
Allow the user to select several images and download them.
Ability to: Select All, Clear Selection
Ability to: Sort by Name A-Z, Sort by Name Z-A
Searchbar to filter displayed images by title or description
Use of styled-components for the UI
Use of react-router-dom - add additional About Me page or any other page you think would be relevant
Create a Custom Hook for Loading and Managing Data
Manage Global and Local State Effectively (can use context, redux, hooks, etc)
Document code where necessary
```

## Instructions

Start by creating an account! You can now access the dashboard and see all of your posts and your friends posts. If desired you can create a new post by clicking on the create post button on the top of the section. You can also click on any post you have previously created in order to edit them or delete them. Once all of your changes are made you can see them on the dashboard for anyone to see! If you want to search for other pets or sort in ascending or descending order click on the dropdown menu or type in the input field. If you wish to download a picture you can either click on the checkbox on each post or click on select all. If you want to clear the download list then click clear all. Once you selected the pictures to be downloaded click on the download button. To sign out simply click the logout button.
